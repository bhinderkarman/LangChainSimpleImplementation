# LangChainSimpleImplementation
This Is a Simple Langchain Implementation that takes a query as input from the user, runs it through the LLM, and outputs the text on screen

I will add a UI/UX element that has a text box that takes an input.

Run that input through the Langchain Framework

Take the output mentioned and display it to the user
